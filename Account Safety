Discord Account Safety 


An useful piece of advice from myself and our staff team to prevent your account being hacked.

What is phishing?
Phishing is a type of attack where the hacker sends victim a fraudulent message to gather their personal information

What happens when I give the attacker my login details?
They can control your account and can view all of your personal info such as your phone number, email ID, etc.
How can I stop this?
Read the following information from our friends at Discord

Don't install any .exe and other unknown files without scanning them or you trust them.
Do not visit any unknown sites, example: discrod.gift/dontclickhere
Do not click on any loading images or accept any unknown friend requests.

Doing any of these will grant access for your account to the hacker.

I'm posting this as because many users in this server and my mutual servers are getting hacked and DM'ing me everyday.
